        <h1 class="post-title">10 (best) Ruby (and Rails) interview questions (and answers)</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p><img class="full-img" src="10%20%28best%29%20Ruby%20%28and%20Rails%29%20interview%20questions%20%28and%20answers%29_files/b4219f3033195daf4be544c8b2a8b5f8.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As lately I was massively involved into the world of recruiting (both
 as candidate, and few month ago as a interviewer — sounds funny, 
right?), I decided to gather all these technical and non-tech questions I
 had during this trial in one place. Order is not important, I write 
this from the top of my head.</p>

<p><strong>1. What is a class, what is an object and why we need modules</strong></p>

<p><em>This may be simple, but it allows to start a conversation between two strangers involved into the same craft.</em></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> classes are a blue-print, they may hold 
data, likely they hold methods; classes are directly connected with an 
idea of objects, because object is an instance of a class. As objects 
are first-class citizens in Ruby, there is a main, root class Object, 
and all classes are inherited from this root entity. Modules, generally,
 are a tool for mix-ins and they provide something we call a namespace. 
Modules cannot be initialised the way we can do this with classes, but 
they provide a multiple inheritance.</p>

<p><strong>2. Who’s _why and what’s up with his Shoes?</strong></p>

<p><em>This is a tricky question, which may allow you to separate Ruby 
newcomers (and I’m not saying this is bad) from old-school warriors (and
 this also may be not so good, as it sounds). Here is why.</em></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> ‘why the lucky stiff’ (or ‘_why’) is the 
artist from a past decade, who used Ruby as his brush, and our minds as a
 canvas. He is both writer, cartoonist, artist, and computer programmer,
 famous by his contribution to many Open Source Ruby projects, “Why’s 
Poignant Guide to Ruby” piece of art and who disappeared in 2009. Shoes 
is a nice OSI project, initially made by _why, and it allows to create 
nice looking GUI applications using Ruby, for programmers of any age 
(from 3 to 100 years old). Shoes now are fine and quite active thanks to
 Shoes Team. You can find it on Github.</p>

<p><strong>3. Why automated testing is a good and bad thing in the same time</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> automated testing (especially as the main 
tool of TDD/BDD) is an absolutely important part of modern applications 
development. This is your friend during refactoring, development and 
debugging. This is the way how you understand your codebase deeper, a 
way to predict bottle-necks, and sometimes it allows you to keep your 
code maintainable without unnecessary investments for years. In the same
 time, automated testing could be a source of terrible bugs and fails, 
as by itself, tests are the same code, as the ‘real’ code. This way, 
automating testing is an another tool to help your mind keep 
architecture and abstractions in the form of the code, speed-up things 
and automate sanity-tests. Which doesn’t mean you always have to pay 
your attention on manual testing.</p>

<p><strong>4. What is Lambda? What is Proc? What is Block? What is Dash Rocket (stabby lambda)?</strong></p>

<p><em>You can literally spend an hour talking about lambdas and procs. Here I’ll outline only the main statements.</em></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> they are from the same plate, however there 
are differences. Firstly, Proc is a nameless function, an anonymous 
method you use very frequently. Procs are objects, Blocks are not. 
Blocks are ‘business cards’ of Ruby, and they are, in fact, a syntax 
literals of Proc; they may take and return values. The main difference 
between Lambdas and Procs is Lambda explicitly check for arguments, 
while Proc is not. Stabby lambda ( -&gt; ) is nothing more than another 
Lambda literal, from Ruby &gt;= 1.9, you may easily think of this like 
of syntax sugar.</p>

<p><strong>5. A practical task: web scraping. The task is to extract 
some information from some web page (pages). For example, to gather all 
top comments from some news site, or product's ratings from some online 
shop.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> there is no ‘correct’ answer here (well, 
excepts this should work as expected). The main idea here is to see how 
it will be done, and the main pre-request from you is ‘go nuts’. This 
way, from this, by itself, simple task, you’ll be able to see how 
candidate does real things with Ruby. If candidate used plain Ruby, or 
it was done with Rack (Sinatra, Rails, whatever) web frontend? Was one 
of CLI frameworks used? What about testing? What about documentation? 
What about fallbacks? What about variables naming? The good thing is 
that even with this simple task, it allows a candidate to spend form 30 
minutes to 3 days, depending on your pre-requests and candidate's mood, 
which could be a good measurement for you.</p>

<p><strong>6. A Rails-specific question: how <code>Date.today</code> differs from <code>Date.current</code>?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It’s all about time zones: with <code>Date.today</code> you’ll have a system date, with <code>Date.current</code> it's system date, plus Rails’ time zone applied. Funny, but <code>Time.zone.today</code> should return you a date with a time zone too.</p>

<p><strong>7. Skinny Controllers. Logic-less (as much as possible) templates. But where we’ll keep this zillions lines of code this way?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> first answer could be, we’ll move 
controller’s code to models. Oookay. But we’ll have Fat Models (tm) this
 way, right? Then we’ll move everything to Rails’ concerns! And we’ll 
separate reusable code as libraries and gems. And this is true. The fact
 is it could be (sic!) even worse than to keep everything in models. One
 of the ways is, for example, to radically change architecture, 
introducing Rails' engines (and here you can talk about differences 
between gem and Rails Engine) or even partially move the code to the 
separated Rack application, and link your host with Rack app via 
internal API (here is the good place to talk about general application 
architecture). Or you can implement Data/Context/Interaction approach 
(here is the good place to talk about advanced architectural themes). 
After this, you’ll feel if it is reasonable to talk about Model-Views 
and Decorators.</p>

<p><strong>8. What is 'self' in Ruby?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> <code>self</code> refers to the current object. The thing is that Class is an object too, this way at class level, <code>self</code> is the class, but at the instance level it is the instance in context, already initialised somewhere in the memory.</p>

<p><strong>9. What is database transactions and how it is represented in Rails</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> transactions are sets of changes, that must 
all be made together. It may, or may not change the contents of the 
database. When we talk about transactions, we usually mean we need to do
 something with database as single unit execution. A classy transaction 
is when you withdraw money from one bank account to another, and you 
need to substract from one bank account and add to another in the same 
time. In Rails you have <code>ActiveRecord::Base.transaction</code>, which allows you to easily pass multiple actions in a block, and they’ll be executed a transactional way.</p>

<p><strong>10. Tell me about your development environment.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> this question is good both for the begining 
and the end of interview. Usually, a good programmer has an attitude to 
his workplace. This could be a minimalistic approach, like 'I use a raw 
vim config, no fancy plugins, because it allows me to have ‘my’ 
workplace on any default config', or candidate could be a tiling window 
manager fan, hacking his i3/Xmonad/awesome config daily, creating custom
 emacs themes for every single period of the day, depending of lighting,
 with the data received from Arduino-based sensor. In any case, you’ll 
both have some fun, talking about this.</p>
